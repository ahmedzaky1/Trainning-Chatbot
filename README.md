# Chatbot
A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users,
especially over the internet. The term "chatbot" is a combination of "chat" (communication) and "bot" (robot).
These programs are often powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies, 
allowing them to understand and respond to user input in a human-like way.

The chatbot model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with additional support from NumPy,
Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. 
The model is designed to understand and generate human-like responses based on the input it receives.
